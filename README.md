## Description

This is a Web Akan name generator, Version 1.0<br>
Akan naming system is a Ghanaian culture. This web application helps them to embrace their culture and generate their name. Normally the name given depends on their gender and the day of week of birth. To get this we need to capture their date of birth and the gender. This will be achieved by a form that allows them to key in the date of birth and gender and a pop up that confirms the generated Akan name.
